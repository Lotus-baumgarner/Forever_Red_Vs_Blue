## League of Legends: Analysis of Main Objectives and Their Impact on Match Outcomes

__By Lotus Baumgarner__

Since its inception in October 2009, League of Legends has emerged as one of the foremost esports globally, boasting a player base and fan following that rivals, and perhaps surpasses, even the NFL. Despite significant evolution since its original client, League of Legends has consistently maintained its reputation as a skill-based, free-to-play game. Monetization is strictly through optional character customization, ensuring no pay-to-win elements.

Each match in League of Legends begins with all players starting at level one. Players must collaborate with their teammates to level up, purchase new items, and achieve various in-game objectives to secure victory.

This project focuses on analyzing the key objectives within League of Legends matches and evaluating their impact on the likelihood of winning. By examining objective-related data, we aim to provide actionable insights into the strategic elements that most significantly influence match outcomes.
